# DIY-Mechanical-Ventilator
An open source, efficient and powerful DIY mechanical ventilator based on Ambu Bag, Arduino, Stepper Motor, TB6600 driver and BMP280 pressure sensor.

## Overview
This is my 4th prototype for diy mechanical ventilators. I build/evaluated many designs including strap based, hammer head style, lever fulcrum based, wiper motor based continous rotation etc. This one outperforms all previous designs in terms of less load on motor, less components, reliable, and easy to build.

## Components
Here is the list of components I am using for this version of ventilator:
1. Ambu Bag
2. Arduino UNO
3. Nema 23 Stepper Motor
4. TB6600 Stepper Motor Driver
5. BMP280/BME280 Pressure Sensor (Optional)
6. 12 volt 5 amp power DC Power Supply
7. 300mm/8mm Threaded Rod with Brass nut
8. Soft Wood / Plywood
9. Potentiometer
10. 1602 LCD
11. Bunch of wires / jumper wires
12. Glue / Nails / Screws  

Now You have everything you need to have for an emergency covid ventilator.

## Schematics
After grabbing required components, let's hook up everything. Here is diagram to hook up arduino, stepper motor, driver, sensor, potentiometer and lcd.
